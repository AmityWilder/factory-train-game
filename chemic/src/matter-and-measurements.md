# Matter and Measurements

[**CHEMISTRY**](self) is defined as the study of matter and the energy associated with physical and
chemical change.

[**MATTER**](Matter) is anything that has mass and takes up space.
Substances of matter can be classified as pure substances or mixtures.

[<u>Compounds</u>](Compound) - contain two or more different elements, and a wide variety of subscripts on the
elements in the compound are possible.

[<u>Elements</u>](Element) - pertain to those you see listed on the periodic table in their naturally occurring state.

Some elements are monoatomic--they exist as single atoms.
- Carbon
- Sodium

Others may exist as <u>molecules</u>--one or more atoms of the same kind bonded together.
- Nitrogen
- Oxygen
- Chlorine

[<u>Molecule</u>](Molecule) – two or more atoms joined together by strong bonds.

[<u>Homogeneous mixtures</u>](Mixture::Homogeneous) - uniform characteristics throughout a sample of substance

[<u>Heterogeneous</u>](Mixture::Heterogeneous) - substances which have many parts that are not the same. A sample from one
part may be different from a sample taken from another part.

## Measuring Matter

Measurements are quantitative data obtained directly from an analytical instrument (for example
a thermometer, analytical balance, graduated cylinder, or ruler).

**UNIT(s)** must follow all measurements. Some common units in the lab are: &deg;C, g, mL, and cm,

*Precision*

Precision is the amount of information conveyed in a number related to its digits. For example,
2.3 cm is less precise than 2.34 cm as the "3" in the tenths place is a less precise increment
than the "4" in the hundredths place.

***Less precise*** | 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 | - | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> | <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10000</sub> | ***More precise***

The precision of a number is determined by the instrument itself. Each instrument has its own
level of precision, and every reading obtained from a single instrument will have the same level
of precision. Keep in mind that the number of significant figures may vary despite numbers
having the same level of precision. For example, consider this digital thermometer. Because the
same instrument is used, all of the readings are ALL precise to the tenths place. However 98.6
&deg;F contains three significant figures while 100.0 &deg;F and 101.8 &deg;F both contain four significant
figures.

*Analytical Balances*

This instrument is a digital instrument used to measure mass. The unit of the measured number
is typically grams (g). When using a digital tool you always write down *every digit shown* in the
display - including all the zeros! Check out the link for more information on [how to use an
analytical balance](://) in the lab.

*Rulers*

Rulers measure length. In the chemistry lab we use metric rulers, most often with centimeters
(cm) as the unit. When using a hatched marking tool always write down the **known digits plus
one estimated digit**. The precision of hatch marked tools, such as a ruler, depends upon the
increments.

2.55 cm is more precise than 2.5cm

*Graduated Cylinders*

This is a common lab piece of liquid volume measuring equipment. The unit of measurement is
typically milliliters (mL). Graduated cylinders come in varying sizes. Graduated cylinders are a
type of hatch marking, and have varying levels of precision. Obtaining an accurate reading
requires proper technique and training. Check out the link for more information on [how to use
and read a graduated cylinder](://).

**Observing Matter**

One of the most important skills of any scientist is their ability to observe, record, and
communicate recorded observations and data. Observations fall into two basic categories —
**qualitative** and **quantitative**.

*Qualitative observations*

are observations that describe **"qualities"** of something. These would include characteristics
such as texture, color, shape, and do not involve counting or measuring. Qualitative data
includes words - NOT numbers.

*Quantitative observations/data*

involve counting or measuring **"quantities"** using standard increments. This would include such
things as mass, volume, time, temperature, frequency of occurrence, etc. Quantitative data
includes numbers and units.

Classifying Properties and Changes in Matter
Properties: Chemical vs Physical
Chemical properties can be observed and measured as the sample changes its chemical
identity and composition.
Physical properties can be observed or measured without changing the chemical composition
of a substance.
Changes: Chemical vs Physical
Chemical changes are transformations resulting in at least one new substance being formed.
Physical changes are transformations in the observable appearance of a substance without a
chemical transformation.

Physical Change Common Observables
State of matter change
A common physical change observable in the lab is a change in the state of matter. For
example, the melting of ice to liquid form is a physical change yet the substance is still H2O,
whether it is called ice (solid) or water (liquid).
Dissolving:
The dissolving of a solid in a liquid (such as salt in water) is a physical change because the
water and salt are both the same chemical substance. Video: https://youtu.be/NNGETOShppM
Chemical Change Common Observables
The combustion of gasoline is a chemical change that transforms the gasoline/oxygen mixture
into a mixture of carbon dioxide, water and other gasses. Energy is closely associated with
chemical changes. Other chemical changes include formation of a gas or solid (precipitation) or
a color change.
Indicators of a Chemical Reaction: https://chemistrytalk.org/what-is-a-chemical-reaction/
● Formation of a Gas product (as bubbles)
● Formation of a Solid product (called a precipitate)
● Color Change
● Change in Energy (system temperate goes up or down)
● Burning, Decomposing (Oxidizing)
Measurements and Density
Numbers and proper use of units is vital in the sciences and math (the language of science).
Many of these numbers you will obtain via in-lab measurements. Other numbers you will obtain
via calculations. The precision and significant figures in a calculated number relate to the
utilized measured numbers involved in the calculations. Three of the four parts of the
experiment involve investigations into density-related concepts and calculations.
MEASUREMENTS
Remember that measurements are data points obtained directly from an analytical instrument
(for example a thermometer, analytical balance, graduated cylinder, or ruler) and measurements
must be followed by a unit (oC, g, mL, cm, etc). In a previous lab we learned how to read values
on an analytical balance, ruler, and graduated cylinder to the correct precision level.
Analytical Balances: Every digit, including zeros, must be recorded. Check out
this link for more details on how to use an analytical balance in the lab.
Rulers: When using a hatched marking tool always write down the known digits
plus one estimated digit. The precision of hatch marked tools, such as a ruler,
depends upon the increments.
2.55 cm is more precise than 2.5cm
Graduated Cylinders Graduated cylinders are a type of hatch marking, and have varying levels
of precision. Obtaining an accurate reading requires proper technique and training. Check out
this link for more information on how to use and read a graduated cylinder.

Calculations & Rounding
The number of significant figures and precision of a calculated number is derived from the
measurements used in the calculations.
Multiplication/Division
The number of significant figures in the final calculated value should be the same as that of the
measured quantity with the fewest number of sig figs used in the calculation.. For example:
3.856 x 105.93 = 4094.1945 should be rounded to 4094
4sf 5sf 4sf
Addition-Subtraction
Your calculated value cannot be more precise than the least precise quantity used in the
calculation. The number of sig figs is not a consideration and may increase or decrease
compared to the measured starting values.
17.23 (precise to hundredths place)
- 9.114 (precise to thousandths place)
8.116 rounded to the hundredth place is 8.12
Unit Conversions
The unit system used for science measurements based on the metric system is called the
International System of units or SI units.
Many times in chemistry we need to convert from one unit of measurement to another. How do
we do that? With conversion factors!
You are already very familiar with dimensional analysis (also called factor label method), though
you may not have realized it.
You think in terms of time all the time! And you can easily go from one unit of time to another.
For example, write the following units of time along with their equivalencies below.
How many seconds are in a minute? ____ s = ____ min
How many minutes are in an hour? ____ min = ____ hr
How many hours are in a day? ____ hr = ____ day
QUESTION:
How many seconds are in 2 days? Express the equivalencies as ratios. These are used as unit
conversion factors.
What quantities are measured?
Important SI units for a given quantity:
Quantity Unit Symbol
length meter m
mass kilogram kg
time second s
temperature kelvin K
volume Liter L
amount of substance mole mol
energy Joule J
SI Prefix Multipliers
Some common units and their equivalencies:
Applying the Method of Dimensional Analysis
Set problems up as a linear equation.
Start with what you know and end with what you want to find out!
Align the numerator and denominator so that they cancel to give
you your target units. This method is applied in Stoichiometry, as
well.
1.) Carry out the following conversion:
a.) 22.6 m to yards b.) 242 lb to milligrams
c.) 3.145 x 109 μg to grams
2.) A slow jogger runs a mile in 13.0 mins. Calculate the speed in:
a.) in/min
b.) mi/hr
3. ) A patient is prescribed 1500 milligrams (mg) of amoxicillin, which is available in 0.300 gram
tablets. How many tablets are needed?
4. ) Which is smaller, a gram or a kilogram?
5.) Which is smaller, a milliliter or a liter?
6.) Many soft drinks are sold in 2-liter bottles. How many milliliters of soft drink are in 2 liters?
7.) The US recommended daily allowances (RDA) values for the vitamins A and E for adult
women are 700 mcg/day and 15 mg/day respectively.
a. How many micrograms (mcg) are present in 15 mg?
b. Which vitamin is needed in higher amounts daily?
Scientific Notation
In science many times very large or very small numbers or measurements are encountered. A
way of expressing a very large or small number is through scientific notation.
All numbers may be expressed in scientific notation of the form: C x 10n
C may be a decimal or a whole number between 1 and 10
n must be a positive or negative whole number
In standard scientific notation, only one number is placed after the decimal for C.
Goal: Convert into and out of scientific notation, identify whether a positive or negative exponent
will result.
Note: If a number is greater than one, the exponent will be a positive whole number.
If the number is less than one, the exponent will be a negative whole number.
Convert the following values into or out of scientific notation:
a) 20,452,384 d) 0.00004928
b) 3 x 103 e) 2.983 x 10 -4
c) 0.03498
Significant Figures
Significant figures (S.F.) refer to the non-place holding digits in a reported measurement; they
represent the precision of an instrument. Certain rules are followed to report to the proper
number of S.F.

non-zero digit (in bold)
0.0542 and 0.00807 Three
AMBIGUOUS: When a number has no
decimal point, any zeros after the last nonzero
digit may or may not be significant (in bold).
These should always be written in scientific
notation.
In a reported measurement
written as 1,860 it is
uncertain if 0 is a certain
value or just a placeholder.
Therefore, it is written as
1.86 X 103
Ambiguous, write

notation.
Rules for Rounding
5’s Rounding Rules
● Drop all non-significant numbers past the last place
● increase by one if the dropped digit is 5 or greater
● stay the same if the dropped digit is 4 or less
Significant Figures in Calculations
Arithmetic with Significant Figures. If there is only one type of operation, simply following the
rules below. For mixed operations carry out the complete calculation (using PEMDAS for order
of operations), taking note of how many SF should be reported after each operation, then apply
the following rules for the final answer.
Addition & Subtraction: Round the sum or difference to the decimal places as the measurement
with the fewest decimal places. Rounding like this indicates your answer can not be any more
precise than the least precise measurement.
Multiplication & Division: Round the product or
quotient so that it has the same number of significant
figures as the least precise measurement – the
measurement with the fewest significant figures.

Accuracy and Precision
Measurements in the lab are dependent on the precision of the instruments and/or tools used to
make those measurements. With this considered, you must write all significant digits associated
with an instruments level of precision.
When an experiment is conducted scientists ensure results are repeatable. In the real world, a
nurse may take the blood pressure three times to make sure she has a correct reading from a
patient. Repeated measurements tests for two concepts, accuracy and precision
Definitions:
Accuracy – describes how closely a measurement approaches an actual true value.
Precision – describes how close repeated measurements are to one another, regardless of how
close those measurements are to the actual value.

Representative glassware used in the lab:
Burette Graduated cylinder Beaker
Precision is expressed with significant figures. A set of rules are followed to determine what is
and what is not significant.
What you need to know about the instruments and tools level of precision used in the
lab:
ALWAYS RECORD PROPER SIGNIFICANT FIGURES AND UNITS!
The analytical balance to measure mass: Report all digits on the digital scale.
Graduated cylinders to measure volume: If using a 100 mL graduated cylinder, read and report
your measurement to one decimal place. Ex. 50.2 mL H2O.
The centimeter ruler to measure length: Report to the nearest hundredth. Ex. 2.31 cm. The 2
and 3 are certain (in 2.31 cm) and 1 estimated (the one in 2.31 cm)
EXAMPLE PROBLEMS:
Read and report to the correct number of significant figures each of the following
measurements.
Percents
% = part/whole X 100%
Percentages are a ratio and can be unit factors.
Density
Density is a physical property of pure substances and, as such, does not vary from sample to
sample. Because the density of a pure substance remains constant, no matter how much of the
substance is present, its value can be used to identify the substance.
Density is a measure of how compact the mass in a substance or object is. The more closely
packed the particles, the higher the density.
Low density High density
Water is a relatively dense liquid and most other liquids are less dense than water. As a result,
most liquids float on top of water. Solids are generally more dense than water and, thus, sink to
the bottom of a container filled with water. Part of this lab will involve the determination of
relative density values for some liquids and solids.
Low density
High density
Density is can be expressed mathematically as the MASS of a substance divided by the
VOLUME of the substance:
If one knows the mass and volume of an object, then the density can be calculated. Mass is
relatively easy to measure in a lab on an analytical balance. Often the volume is the more
difficult variable to determine. In lab one can calculate or determine volume two ways:
geometric and/or displacement.
Geometric measurements can be used to calculate the volume for regular shaped solids (cubes,
cylinders, etc). However, water displacement measurements must be used to calculate the
volume of irregularly shaped solids (rocks, penny, etc).
Since density is calculated from mass and volume measurements, it is important to record all
measured values to the proper number of significant digits. The number of significant digits is
determined by the type of equipment used to take the measurement. Simple rules are used to
determine the number of significant digits in answers to calculations involving measured data.
At times a comparison of significant digits for volume measurements using different volume
measuring devices is needed.
Density via GEOMETRIC VOLUME calculations:
Geometric volume calculations involve plugging the measured dimensions of an object into a
known volume equation.
For example:
A gold cylinder was measured to have a length of 1.06 cm and a diameter of 3.98 cm.
Its mass was measured to be 254.520 g.
1. Determine the VOLUME of the gold cylinder using the known equation
for volume
pi = 3.14…, r = radius (half of the diameter), L = length
2. Determine the DENSITY by plugging the values into the equation.
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES in the above calculations:
● The volume is calculated by multiplication. The number of significant figures recorded in
the answer is 3. This is based upon the least number of significant figures in the data
(radius and length only have 3).
● The density is calculated by division. The number of significant figures recorded in the
answer is 3. This is based upon the least number of significant figures in the data
(volume only has 3).
Density by VOLUME DISPLACEMENT calculations:
Volume displacement is a two step lab process. Initially the volume of water is precisely
measured in a graduated cylinder. The irregular object is then immersed in the water. The final
volume of the water containing the object is recorded. The volume of the object is Vfinal-Vinitial.
Example:
A gold nugget with an irregular shape also had a mass of 254.520 g.
The nugget was inserted into a graduated cylinder initially filled with 48.9 mL
of water. The final water volume, with the gold nugget submerged in the water,
was measured at 62.0 mL.
1. To calculate the density of the gold cylinder, its volume must be calculated first.
Determine the VOLUME of the cylinder, by water displacement.
2. Determine the DENSITY
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES in the above calculations:
● The volume is calculated by subtraction. Looking at
place value, the answer is carried out to the tenth
place (one place to the right of the decimal).
● The density is calculated by division. The number
of significant figures recorded in the answer is 3.
This is based upon the least number of significant
figures in the data (volume only has 3).
Known Density Table (to the right)
1. You need to determine the density of an irregularly-shaped object that has a mass of
4.55 g. You carefully place the object in a graduated cylinder containing 19.4 mL of water
and find that the volume is displaced to 23.1 mL. What is the density of the object?
2. Liquid water has a density of 1000. kg/L, while ice has a density of 920. kg/L. Calculate
the volume occupied by 0.250 kg of each.
3. The density of gold is 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter. What is the mass of a bar of gold
in kilograms that measures 6.00 inches x 4.00 inches x 2.00 inches?

points of water.
Temperature Conversion
1. If room temperature is 22 °C, what is this temperature in kelvin? Fahrenheit?
2. If a sunny summer day is 93 °F, what is this temperature in °C?

Energy
Definitions
Energy—the capacity to do work or supply heat
Kinetic energy—energy of motion
Potential energy—stored energy (often chemical)
The amount of potential or kinetic energy present in an object is directly proportional to the
object’s mass.
The SI unit for energy is the joule (J) and the customary unit is the calorie (cal). These two units
are related to each other as:
1 cal = 4.184 J
The calorie listed on nutritional labels is called a nutritional Calorie (Cal) and is 1,000 times
larger than a calorie.
1 Calorie = 1,000 calories

a. How many calories are in the sandwich?
b. How many Joules are in the sandwich?
3. Which has more kinetic energy, a patient sitting in a wheelchair or a patient being pushed in a
wheelchair?
